## Course Objectives

- Understand the concept and the solution of partial differential equations.
- Analyse and solve one-dimensional wave equation and heat equation.
- Understand complex functions, their continuity and differentiability using Cauchy-Riemann equations.

## Course Content

### Module I: Partial Differential Equations

- Formation of partial differential equations:
 - Elimination of arbitrary constants and arbitrary functions.
- Solutions of partial differential equations.
- Equations solvable by direct integration.
- Linear equations of the first order – Lagrange’s linear equation.
- Non-linear equations of the first order – Charpit’s method.
- Solution of equations by method of separation of variables.

### Module II: Applications of Partial Differential Equations

- One-dimensional wave equation:
- Vibrations of a stretched string.

### Module III: Complex Variable – Differentiation

- Complex function, limit, continuity, derivative.
- Analytic functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations.
- Harmonic functions, finding harmonic conjugates.
- Conformal mappings:
  - \( w = z^2 \), \( w = e^z \), \( w = \frac{1}{z} \), \( w = \sin z \).
  - Linear fractional transformations and fixed points.

### Module IV: Complex Variable – Integration

- Complex integration.
- Line integrals in the complex plane, basic properties.

- Cauchy integral formula for derivatives of an analytic function.
- Taylor’s and Maclaurin series.

### Module V: Complex Variable – Residue Integration

- Laurent’s series (without proof).
