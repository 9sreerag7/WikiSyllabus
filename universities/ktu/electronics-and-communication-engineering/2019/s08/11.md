# ECT436: Adaptive Signal Processing

## Course Objectives

- Understand the basic concepts of statistical signal processing.
- Devise filtering solutions for optimising the cost function indicating error in estimation of parameters and appreciate the need for adaptation in design.
- Evaluate the performance of various methods for designing adaptive filters through estimation of different parameters of stationary random processes, considering practical application specifications.
- Analyse convergence and stability issues associated with adaptive filter design and propose optimum solutions for real-life applications, balancing complexity and accuracy.
- Design and implement filtering solutions for applications such as channel equalisation, interference cancelling, and prediction, addressing present-day challenges.
