# ECT426: Real Time Operating Systems

## Course Objectives

- Summarize the functions and structure of general-purpose operating systems.
- Use different scheduling algorithms on processes and threads.
- Interpret a real-time operating system along with its synchronization, communication, and interrupt handling tools.
- Illustrate task constraints and analyze different scheduling algorithms on tasks.
- Illustrate applications of real-time operating systems.

## Course Content

### Module I: Operating System Basics
- Types, objectives, and functions of operating systems.
- Kernel.
- Process: states, Process Control Block (PCB), operations on processes.

### Module II: Process and Thread Scheduling
- Process scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin, Multilevel Queue, Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling.
- Threads: structure, user-level and kernel-level threads, multithreading models.
- Multiprocessor scheduling.

### Module III: Real Time Operating Systems
- Structure and characteristics of real-time systems.
- Task: task states.
- Task synchronization: semaphores (types).
- Inter-task communication mechanisms: message queues, pipes, event registers, signals.
- Exceptions and interrupt handling.

### Module IV: Task Constraints and Scheduling
- Task constraints.
- Aperiodic task scheduling: EDD, EDF, LDF, EDF with precedence constraints.
- Periodic task scheduling: Rate Monotonic, Deadline Monotonic.
- Real-time kernel: structure, state transition diagram, kernel primitives.

### Module V: RTOS Features and Applications
