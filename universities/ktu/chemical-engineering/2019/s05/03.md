# CHT305: Chemical Reaction Engineering

## Course Objectives
* Explain the principles of chemical kinetics and determine kinetic parameters using batch reactor data.  
* Design ideal chemical reactors for single reactions.  
* Analyse and design single and multiple reactions in ideal reactors.  
* Develop reactor designs for non-isothermal conditions.  
* Evaluate reactor performance under non-ideal flow conditions.  

## Modules
