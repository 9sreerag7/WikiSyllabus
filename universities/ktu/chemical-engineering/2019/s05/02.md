# CHT303: Environmental Engineering

## Course Objectives
* Explain environmental legislation and regulations for environmental protection.  
* Describe different treatment processes for drinking water, municipal water, boiler feed water, and saline water.  
* Interpret primary, secondary, and tertiary wastewater treatment methods.  
* Compare aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment methods.  
* Select suitable treatment and disposal methods for sludge, industrial, and hazardous wastes.  
* Identify sources of air and noise pollution and propose control methods.  

## Modules

### Module 1 – Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Water/Wastewater Treatment
* Environmental engineering overview – legislation and regulations.  
* Water quality standards and treatment processes – precipitation, alum and lime soda softening.  
* Municipal water conditioning, ion exchange, boiler feed water treatment, desalination.  
* Sources and classification of wastewater, types of water pollutants.  
* Wastewater sampling, preservation, and analysis – physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.  
* Determination of solids, BOD, COD, DO (Oxygen Sag Curve), and wastewater microbiology.  

### Module 2 – Wastewater Treatment Methods
* Pretreatment, primary, secondary, tertiary, and advanced treatment processes.  
* Screening, grit removal, oil removal, equalization, neutralization, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation.  
* Clarifiers, clariflocculation.  
* Aerobic processes – activated sludge, trickling filters, oxidation ditches, aeration lagoons, RBCs, aerobic fluidized bed bioreactors.  
* Anaerobic processes – digestion, anaerobic filter, contact process, anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactors, UASB.  
* Disinfection – chlorination, ozonation, adsorption sand filters.  

### Module 3 – Sludge, Solid and Hazardous Waste Treatment
* Sludge treatment – thickening, conditioning, dewatering, digestion, composting.  
* Solid waste – sources, classification, collection and disposal methods (open dumping, sanitary landfill, incineration, composting).  
* Industrial waste treatment – pulp and paper, textile, distillery, dairy, petroleum refinery, fertilizer industry.  
* Hazardous waste – types, health effects, treatment, and disposal.  

### Module 4 – Air Quality and Pollution
* Air pollution – units, sources, classification, sampling, and analysis.  
* Effects of air pollution – global warming, ozone depletion.  
* Meteorological factors – lapse rates, pressure, wind, moisture, dispersion.  
* Air quality modelling – Pasquill’s stability classes, Gaussian dispersion model, stack height design.  

### Module 5 – Air and Noise Pollution Control Systems
* Air pollution control devices:  
  - For particulates – gravitational settling, centrifugal collectors, wet collectors, fabric filters, ESPs.  
  - For gases – adsorption, absorption, condensation, combustion, automobile emission control.  
* Noise pollution – effects and control methods.
