# CHT204: Heat Transfer Operations

## Course Objectives
* Identify and distinguish various modes of heat transfer and examine the mechanisms involved.  
* Apply appropriate governing equations and analyse conduction heat transfer problems for different geometries under steady and transient processes.  
* Solve forced and natural convection heat transfer problems using empirical equations.  
* Explain the concepts behind radiation heat transfer and solve radiation heat transfer problems.  
* Analyse the heat transfer processes involved in boiling and condensation.  
* Design heat exchangers and evaporators after interpreting the basic concepts.  

## Modules

### Module 1 – Conduction
* Modes of heat transfer – conduction, convection, radiation; applications in engineering.  
* Material properties – thermal conductivity, specific heat, isotropic/anisotropic materials.  
* General heat conduction equation (derivation in Cartesian coordinates).  
* Steady-state conduction through plane, cylindrical, and spherical walls (with and without heat generation).  
* Composite systems, conduction-convection systems, electrical analogy.  
* Critical radius of insulation, optimum thickness, thermal contact resistance.  
* Unsteady-state conduction – lumped capacity analysis, Biot modulus, Fourier number.

### Module 2 – Convection
* Mechanism of convection, boundary layer concepts, convective heat transfer coefficient.  
* Dimensional analysis (Rayleigh & Buckingham π theorem).  
* Forced convection – empirical correlations for laminar/turbulent flow in pipes, plates, cylinders, spheres, tube banks.  
* Natural convection – laminar/turbulent correlations, significance of Grashof & Rayleigh numbers.  
* Analogy between momentum and heat transfer (Reynold’s analogy).

### Module 3 – Radiation, Boiling & Condensation
* Radiation heat transfer – emissive power, emissivity, black/gray bodies, radiation laws.  
* Radiation between surfaces, view factors, radiation shields.  
* Boiling – boiling curve, nucleate and film boiling, empirical correlations (Rohsenow, Zuber).  
* Condensation – film and dropwise condensation, Nusselt analysis for vertical plate.

### Module 4 – Heat Exchangers
* Classification of heat exchangers (construction, fluids, transfer mechanisms, flow arrangements).  
* Shell and tube heat exchanger – construction and components.  
* Overall heat transfer coefficient, fouling factors.  
* LMTD and NTU methods – equations, correction factors, design calculations.  
* Temperature-distance plots for various flow arrangements.

### Module 5 – Evaporators
* Principle and types of evaporators – natural/forced circulation, film evaporators, agitated thin film, plate evaporators.  
* Auxiliary components – vacuum devices, steam traps, entrainment separators.  
* Single and multiple effect evaporators – capacity, economy, material & energy balances.  
* Feeding arrangements – forward, backward, mixed feeding (merits & demerits).
