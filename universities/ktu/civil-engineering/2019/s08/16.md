# CET418 Earthquake Resistant Design

## Course Objectives

- Formulate appropriate SDOF models of simple structural systems under dynamic loads and apply them to the solution of engineering problems.  
- Analyze and interpret the dynamic response of SDOF systems for various dynamic inputs.  
- Develop appropriate mathematical models for 2 DOF systems and MDOF shear building models and estimate the natural frequencies and vibration modes for the same.  
- Explain the basics of engineering seismology, ground motion characteristics, behavior of structures to ground motion and appreciate the various principles of seismic design philosophy.  
- Apply the provisions of various Indian seismic design standards for the estimation of seismic demand over structures.
