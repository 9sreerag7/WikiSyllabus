# AG6CBP1.1: Choice Based Course - UI Design

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
This course explores the design of digital interfaces, how humans interact with them, and the complete process of creating a user interface from research to final design. By the end of this course, you will be able to:
* Understand the human experience design process, from UX research to UI design.
* Apply core principles of UI design related to organization (consistency, layout), economy (simplicity, clarity), and communication (balance, legibility).
* Design effective interface elements using graphical techniques, semiotics, color, and animation.
* Conduct user research and translate it into practical wireframes, site maps, and mockups.
* Build a complete UI design project based on brand guidelines and a clear user flow.

## Course Content

### **Module 1**
