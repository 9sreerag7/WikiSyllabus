Specifically, students will be able to:
* Identify and use classical animation equipment and understand the workflow, including keyframes, in-betweens, and exposure sheets.
* Apply foundational animation methods like 'pose to pose' and 'straight ahead' action while maintaining volume.
* Incorporate acting principles, including posing, timing, and body language, into animation.
* Execute experiments based on the 12 basic principles of animation.
* Animate various character movements like walks, runs, and jumps, demonstrating an understanding of mass and weight.
