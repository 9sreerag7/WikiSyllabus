# AG4PRP04: Stop Motion Animation

## Course Objectives and Outcomes

* Differentiate between time-lapse and stop motion techniques and create a time-lapse animation.
* Understand the general workflow of stop motion, from scripting and character creation to post-production.
* Complete a cutout animation project, including model and set design.
* Complete a puppet/clay animation project, including armature creation and set design.
* Complete a pixilation project and understand the basics of sand animation.
