# AG1CRP02: Elements of Graphic Design

## Course Objectives
* To provide students with the initial information to help understand how to design what is seen in a frame and to understand basic elements and principles in design. 

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Identify and define the basic elements of graphic design including Line, Shape, Form, Space, Colour, Texture, and Type. 
* **CO 2:** Apply the basic principles of design such as balance, proportion, rhythm, and unity, and understand Gestalt theory. 
* **CO 3:** Develop visual compositions and layouts using concepts of visual hierarchy, grids, and visual interest. 
* **CO 4:** Create designs for logos and posters by brainstorming, concept development, and applying design principles. 

## Course Content

### Module - 1
* [cite_start]Introduction to basic elements of graphic design: Line, Shape, Forms, Space, Colour (subtractive and additive, colour wheel, hue, saturation, value, schemes, and meaning), Texture (visual and tactile). [cite: 167]
* [cite_start]Type: typeface, typeface family, and its role as a graphical element. [cite: 168]

### Module - 2
* [cite_start]Basic principles of design: balance, proportion, rhythm, emphasis, unity etc. [cite: 170]
* [cite_start]Laws of perception -Gestalt theory: similarity, proximity, continuity, closure etc. [cite: 170]
* [cite_start]Scale and proportion in design-Mathematical ratios and proportional systems: Fibonacci numbers, The Golden Ratio. [cite: 170]

### Module - 3
* [cite_start]Concepts of visual design: Design methodology, problem-solving -Visual structure and visual Interest, visual analysis and refinement. [cite: 172]
* [cite_start]Exercises on visual composition and layout: Hierarchy, Centre of visual Impact, reading a page (active/passive areas, F Pattern, Inverted pyramid). [cite: 173]
* [cite_start]The use of grids in graphics composition: Grid types, Formats, Margins, Columns, Gutters, and the relationship of visual form to meaning. [cite: 174]

### Module - 4
* [cite_start]Exercise based on nature study: Observing and applying patterns, colour schemes, and shapes from nature. [cite: 176]

### Module - 5
* [cite_start]Brainstorming: Creative problem-solving, identifying needs, target audience, concept development, and drafting ideas. [cite: 178]
* [cite_start]Tessellation of shapes (geometric and organic) with various colour schemes. [cite: 179]
* [cite_start]Exercise on logo design: Considerations of size, colours, and typographic selections. [cite: 180]
* [cite_start]Poster Design/ Advertisement design: Designing various types of posters (Propaganda, Event, campaign) and applying grid systems. [cite: 181]
