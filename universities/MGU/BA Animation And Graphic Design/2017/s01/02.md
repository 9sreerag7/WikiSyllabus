# AG1CRP02: Elements of Graphic Design

## Course Objectives
* To provide students with the initial information to help understand how to design what is seen in a frame and to understand basic elements and principles in design. 

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Identify and define the basic elements of graphic design including Line, Shape, Form, Space, Colour, Texture, and Type. 
* **CO 2:** Apply the basic principles of design such as balance, proportion, rhythm, and unity, and understand Gestalt theory. 
* **CO 3:** Develop visual compositions and layouts using concepts of visual hierarchy, grids, and visual interest. 
* **CO 4:** Create designs for logos and posters by brainstorming, concept development, and applying design principles. 

## Course Content

### Module - 1
* Introduction to basic elements of graphic design: Line, Shape, Forms, Space, Colour (subtractive and additive, colour wheel, hue, saturation, value, schemes, and meaning), Texture (visual and tactile).
* Type: typeface, typeface family, and its role as a graphical element. 

### Module - 2
* Basic principles of design: balance, proportion, rhythm, emphasis, unity etc. 
* Laws of perception -Gestalt theory: similarity, proximity, continuity, closure etc.
* Scale and proportion in design-Mathematical ratios and proportional systems: Fibonacci numbers, The Golden Ratio. 

### Module - 3
* Concepts of visual design: Design methodology, problem-solving -Visual structure and visual Interest, visual analysis and refinement. 
* Exercises on visual composition and layout: Hierarchy, Centre of visual Impact, reading a page (active/passive areas, F Pattern, Inverted pyramid). 
* The use of grids in graphics composition: Grid types, Formats, Margins, Columns, Gutters, and the relationship of visual form to meaning.

### Module - 4
* Exercise based on nature study: Observing and applying patterns, colour schemes, and shapes from nature. 

### Module - 5
*Brainstorming: Creative problem-solving, identifying needs, target audience, concept development, and drafting ideas. 
* Tessellation of shapes (geometric and organic) with various colour schemes. 
* Exercise on logo design: Considerations of size, colours, and typographic selections. 
* Poster Design/ Advertisement design: Designing various types of posters (Propaganda, Event, campaign) and applying grid systems.
