# AG1CRP03: Rudiments of Animation Drawing

## Course Objectives
* [cite_start]To provide the student an understanding of basic drawing techniques for animation. [cite: 190]

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Identify and use different drawing materials and tools, both dry and wet media. *(Cognitive level: Understand)*
* **CO 2:** Practice fundamental drawing skills like doodling, line work, and creating shapes from memory and imagination. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
* **CO 3:** Develop observational drawing skills through still-life, live model studies, and quick sketching to capture gestures and poses. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
* **CO 4:** Apply the principles of perspective drawing (one, two, and three-point) to create depth. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
* **CO 5:** Demonstrate understanding of light and shading to create three-dimensional form. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*
