# AG1CRP03: Rudiments of Animation Drawing

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
This course is intended to give you a solid understanding of basic drawing techniques specifically for animation. After completing this course, you'll be able to:
* Identify and use a variety of drawing materials and tools.
* Practice fundamental drawing skills like line work and creating shapes from memory.
* Develop observational drawing skills through still-life and live model studies.
* Apply the principles of perspective drawing to create depth.
* Demonstrate an understanding of light and shading to create three-dimensional form.

## Course Content

### **Module 1**
* **Drawing Materials**: An introduction to different drawing materials and tools, including dry media (pencils, charcoals), wet media (pens, brushes), inks, paints, and various surfaces.

### **Module 2**
* **Fundamental Skills**: Covers doodling, noodling, drawing straight and curved lines, free-hand drawing, holding the pencil correctly, and drawing shapes from memory and with grids.

### **Module 3**
* **Observational Drawing**: Focuses on still-life drawing and sketching from live models to capture poses, gestures, and attitude. It also introduces concepts like line of action, balance, rhythm, and caricature.

### **Module 4**
* **Perspective**: Teaches perspective drawing, including one-point, two-point, and three-point perspectives, vanishing points, eye level, and foreshortening.

### **Module 5**
* **Light and Shade**: Explores tones, lighting, and shading with a basic 3D light setup. Covers different types of shadows like cast shadow, contact shadow, and core shadow to create form.
