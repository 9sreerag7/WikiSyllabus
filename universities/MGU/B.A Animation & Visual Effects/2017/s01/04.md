# AG1PRP01: Techniques of Photographic Composition

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
This project-based course is intended to help you understand the basic knowledge of image-making using a digital camera and to introduce you to fundamental picture composition techniques. Upon completion, you will be able to:
* Understand the psychology of visual perception and aesthetics in filmmaking.
* Apply principles of picture composition, including image sizes, camera angles, balance, and rules like the rule of thirds.
* Operate a DSLR camera, controlling shutter, lenses, aperture, and focus to manage exposure and depth of field.
* Understand and use the grammar of motion pictures, including camera movements and principles of continuity like the 180° rule.
* Complete a project that demonstrates the practical application of photographic composition techniques.
