# AV4CRP06: 3D Character Motion

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
In this course, you will apply the principles of traditional animation to 3D computer animation, focusing on acting skills that strengthen visual communication using 3D software. You will learn to:
* Understand key 3D animation terminology and create strong, clear poses using 3D rigs.
* Use animation passes (blocking, breakdowns, in-betweens) and clean up animation using the Graph Editor.
* Apply the 12 principles of traditional animation within a 3D software environment.
* Create cyclic animations like walks and runs, and apply principles of weight and secondary action.
* Animate complex body mechanics like pushes, pulls, and lifts using video references.

## Course Content

### **Module 1**
* **3D Animation Basics**: Terminology (Timeline, Keyframe, Frame rate). Working with 3D Rigs, importance of poses, line of action, and silhouette. Understanding twinning and positive/negative spaces.

### **Module 2**
* **The Animation Process**: Setting up animation preferences. The concept of pose-to-pose in 3D using animation passes (Blocking, Breakdowns, In-betweens). Cleaning up animation using the Graph Editor and Dope Sheet.

### **Module 3**
* **Applying Traditional Principles**: Applying the principles of traditional animation (Squash and Stretch, Timing, Anticipation, Staging, Arcs, etc.) to 3D computer animation.

### **Module 4**
* **Cyclic Animation**: Creating walk, run, and sneak cycles. Animating jumps. Using exposure sheets and the dope sheet to adjust timing and spacing. Exercises in weight, mass, and secondary action.

### **Module 5**
* **Body Mechanics**: Using animation constraints. Animating body language, action-reaction, push and pull, lift, and throw. Discussing the use of video references in animation.
