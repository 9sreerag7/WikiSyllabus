# AV4CRP04: Visual Effects I

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
This course is a continuation of "Introduction to Motion Graphics" and introduces you to advanced tools and compositing techniques for visual effects. You will learn to:
* Understand the principles of chroma key compositing, including lighting and shooting techniques.
* Perform primary and secondary color correction and basic color grading to match shots.
* Use rotoscoping techniques with splines to create mattes for complex shots.
* Perform motion tracking, stabilization, and camera tracking for set extensions and other effects.
* Plan a VFX shot and understand other applications like morphing and crowd replication.

## Course Content

### **Module 1**
* **Chroma Key Compositing**: The difference between visual and special effects. Principles of chroma keying, pulling a matte, and performing despill operations. Techniques for lighting and shooting on a chroma screen.

### **Module 2**
* **Color Correction and Grading**: Primary and secondary color correction. Techniques for correcting and matching shots, basic color grading, color balancing, and using vignettes.

### **Module 3**
* **Rotoscoping**: The uses and advantages of rotoscoping. Creating rotos with splines, using hierarchical shapes, interpolation, and keyframing to create accurate mattes for motion blur and semi-transparency.

### **Module 4**
* **Tracking**: Techniques for motion tracking, motion stabilization, and camera tracking (including Mocha). Creating set extensions and using time-stretching, time-remapping, and time warp effects.

### **Module 5**
* **VFX Planning**: How to approach and plan a VFX shot. Other VFX applications like morphing, adding atmospheres, and crowd replication. Basics of stereo compositing and understanding a VFX breakdown.
