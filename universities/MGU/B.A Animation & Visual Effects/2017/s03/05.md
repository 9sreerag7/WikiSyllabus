# AV3CRP02: Rigging for Animation

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
This course will introduce you to the various methods of rigging, which is an essential part of 3D animation, allowing you to develop your technical skills in character setup. After this course, you will be able to:
* Create and manipulate skeleton joints, use IK and FK systems, and set up rig controls.
* Use expressions and basic scripting to aid in the rigging process.
* Create rigs for both props and characters, and apply deformers and skinning.
* Understand and apply a muscle system to a character rig for more realistic deformation.
* Complete a rigging project under the guidance of a supervising faculty.

## Course Content

### **Module 1**
* **Rigging Fundamentals**: Study of skeleton setups, skeleton creation, joints, IK and FK, attribute controls, and rig controls. Using constraints, locking channels, custom attributes, and driven keys.

### **Module 2**
* **Joints and Hierarchies**: Using expressions and basic scripting. Creating and organizing joint hierarchies, orienting and mirroring joints. Using rotate plane solvers, custom attributes, spline IK, and human inverse kinematics.

### **Module 3**
* **Skinning and Deformation**: Creating rigs for props and characters. Using deformers, skinning (interactive/smooth binding), controlling and painting skin weights, and using blend shapes.

### **Module 4**
* **Muscle Systems**: Understanding muscle systems, using capsules, creating a muscle with muscle builder, editing muscle parameters, and converting smooth skin to a muscle system. Rigging a cartoon character with a muscle system.

### **Module 5**
* **Project Work**: A project based on the syllabus and parameters of the course, completed under the guidance of a supervising faculty member.
