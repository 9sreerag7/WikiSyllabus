# AV3CRP01: Introduction to Motion Graphics

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
This course trains you in the essential vocabularies and concepts of motion graphics using type, shapes, objects, and images for television, film titles, and advertising. By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
* Understand the difference between node-based and layer-based compositing and navigate the After Effects interface.
* Manage and animate layers using keyframes, the graph editor, blending modes, and parenting.
* Create and animate masks, use track mattes, and apply effects from the effects panel.
* Work in a 3D space by creating and animating 3D layers, cameras, and lights.
* Render a final project using the render queue and understand export settings.

## Course Content

### **Module 1**
* **Motion Graphics Basics**: What is motion graphics? Introduction to node-based vs. layer-based compositing, file formats, and the After Effects interface, panels, and project settings.

### **Module 2**
* **Layers and Animation**: Layer management (selecting, moving, trimming). Animating layer properties with keyframes and the Graph Editor. Using blending modes, adjustment layers, null objects, and parenting.

### **Module 3**
* **Masking and Effects**: Creating, feathering, and animating masks. Using track mattes (Luma and Alpha), applying motion blur, understanding pre-composition, and using the puppet tool. Applying effects and simple expressions.

### **Module 4**
* **3D Space**: Working with 3D layers, including 3D rotation and motion paths. Creating and animating cameras and lights in 3D space. Performing multiplane compositing to create depth.

### **Module 5**
* **Rendering**: Using the render queue panel, understanding render settings and output module settings. Introduction to Adobe Media Encoder for final export.
