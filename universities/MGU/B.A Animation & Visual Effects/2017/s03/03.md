# AG3PRP03: Classical Animation

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
This course aims to provide a solid foundation in the principles of animation, combined with observational studies essential for an animator. You will learn to plan scenes visually, understand composition, and design characters. Upon completion, you will be able to:
* Identify and use classical animation equipment and understand the workflow, including keyframes and exposure sheets.
* Apply foundational animation methods like 'pose to pose' and 'straight ahead' while maintaining volume.
* Execute experiments based on the 12 basic principles of animation.
* Incorporate acting principles, including posing, timing, and body language, into animation.
* Animate various character movements like walks, runs, and jumps, demonstrating an understanding of mass and weight.

## Course Content

### **Module 1**
* **Animation Fundamentals**: Introduction to animation equipment (Cels, Light box, Peg bars), line tests, field charts, and the rostrum camera. Understanding the exposure sheet (X-Sheet) and concepts like keyframes, in-betweens, and clean-up.

### **Module 2**
* **Drawing for Animation**: Understanding line of action, path of action, maintaining volume, and key drawings. Working with extremes, breakdowns, and in-betweens. Using timing ladders and numbering drawings. Animation methods: Straight ahead vs. Pose to pose.

### **Module 3**
* **Principles of Animation**: Practical experiments with the basic principles of animation, including squash and stretch, anticipation, staging, follow through, slow in/slow out, arcs, timing, and appeal.

### **Module 4**
* **Acting for Animators**: Character acting, the difference between stage and animation acting, basics of animation acting (posing, timing, staging), voice acting, expressions, and body language.

### **Module 5**
* **Character Locomotion**: Animating walks (normal and stylized), runs, jumps, skips, and leaps. Creating takes and double takes, and showing anticipation, overlapping actions, mass, and weight.
